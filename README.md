**What is this?** This repository was created as a practice repository but I think that it could be helpful for other engineers to practice as well as me. This repository contains a set of interview problems that I collected from some sites and books. The problems are related to the topics:

* [Arrays and strings](./arrays_and_strings/README.md)
* [Linked lists](./linked_lists/README.md)
* [Stack and queues](./stack_and_queues/README.md)
* [Trees and graphs](./trees_and_graphs/README.md)
